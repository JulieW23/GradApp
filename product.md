#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build an Android app that enables better communication between teachers and parents. Parents are busy these days, so it makes it difficult for them to speak to teachers, or attend parent-teacher meetings. The app enables parents to keep track of their child’s education by providing a centralized platform for school updates and notifications. Teachers and parents can also communicate via a private chat channel.  Parents can stay in touch with other parents via a group chat. There is calendar support for events created by teacher which can be viewed by parents. Teachers can send parents pictures of their child in special or everyday school events parents may not be able to attend.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

The target users are for the teachers and parents of children who attend private daycare or private elementary school. These parents are usually working professionals who want to be apart of their child’s education, but cannot due to work. The adoption of this mobile application should be high amongst this demographic because they all know how to use a smartphone and understand english. This gives the school an incentive to purchase and roll-out the application if each child has a parent who can use the application.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Private daycare or schools can adopt this application to maintain a competitive edge against rival schools. This application can help a school become more favourable amongst parents since it provides a convenient centralized place for school updates and allows teachers to share photos of precious moments from school events that doting parents would hate to miss out on. Parent can just glance at it while working, and respond with comments or questions. The parents can also be notified in case of emergencies or reminded of upcoming deadlines for fees, forms, required items for special events etc.. It is not time consuming for the parents.  Better communication between parents and teachers can increase the quality of education in of a child.

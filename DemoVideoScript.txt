Introduction (~30s)
------------

Hello, we are building an Android app to faciliate easier communication between teachers and parents. 
Teachers can use our app to post class and  student-specific updates to parents. 
Parents can view these updates in the app and follow-up with the teachers via a private chat.
The admin is in charge of managing teacher accounts and classes.
We will demo the main workflow of the parent user and discuss the other 2 user types, teacher and admin.

Similarly, the admin can view (manage classes screen), create (create class screen) and delete classes (view class screen).

That concludes the demo. We saw the main workflow of the parent user and discussed the features in the teacher and admin user types. 
We have completed most of the user interfaces and we plan to concentrate on building the back-end functionality.

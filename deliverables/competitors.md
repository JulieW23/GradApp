After carefully evaluating a number of competitor apps and websites, we realized that most of them are providing similar services to our app: easier and more efficient communication between parents and daycare workers, allowing people to know about upcoming events, etc.
They also automate some of the time consuming-tasks daycare workers need to do, such as writing report or sending feedback to parents. In addition, parents can create a journal for their kids to store their photos (like a photo album) and interesting daily stories.

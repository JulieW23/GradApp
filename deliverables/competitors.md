#Findings of Competitor Evaluation

After carefully evaluating a number of competitor applications and websites (HiMama, Daily Sheets, and ClassDojo), we realized that most of them are providing similar services to the application we intend to build: easier and more efficient communication between parents and daycare workers, allowing people to know about upcoming events, etc. through text, picture and/or video updates.

They also automate some of the time consuming-tasks daycare workers need to do, such as writing reports or sending feedback to parents. In addition, parents can create a journal for their kids to store their photos (like a photo album) and interesting daily stories.

Although they were quite similar to the product we propose, we determined through reading user reviews of the applications, there are still features missing in these solutions that parents would like to have, particularly capability to receive longer video updates, and calendar integration for event and deadline reminders. 

Also, there is a feature some parents did not like that we will not include in our app. For example, ClassDojo has a scoring system for students where students are rewarded for good behaviour with points and punished for bad behviour with deduction of points. The scores of each student in the class are accessible by everyone in the class. Although students with high scores will benefit from being recognized, students with low scores are subjected to unnecessary competition and will feel self-conscious about their class standing being publicized.

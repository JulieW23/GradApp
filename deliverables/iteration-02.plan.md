#### Events

 * Meeting 1: October 28th
   * discussed user roles/capabilities
   * follow-up questions:
     * should we create a desktop interface for admins so that it is easier for them to do their job (it is inconvenient to create lots and lots of user accounts on a phone?
     * team roles?
 * Meeting 2: November 1st
   * designed user work flow(s)
   * follow-up questions:
     * should we create administrator users?
     * how should teachers register for the app? how should parents register and become associated with a class? how should students be enrolled in a class?
     * team roles?
 * Meeting 3: November 4th
   * completed user workflow diagram, incl. administrative user
   * started assigning team roles
   * follow-up questions:
     * do we need to divide the back-end roles into more specific ones?
     * if so, how do we divide the back-end roles?
 * Meeting 4: November 10th
   * decided to add web interface for administrator users to create batches of teacher accounts/classes
   * assigned back-end roles

## Product

Goals and tasks:
 
 1. Create workflow
   * Workflow begins from the login screen, and branches to three different user categories: administrator, teacher, and parent
 2. Create wireframe
   * A workflow must be created to ease the creation of the wireframe
 3. Create teacher interface
   * A wireframe must be created for the front-end developers to use as a guide for the interface
 4. Create parent interface
   * A wireframe must be created for the front-end developers to use as a guide for the interface
 5. Create administrator interface
   * A wireframe must be created for the front-end developers to use as a guide for the interface
 6. Create app class structure (eg. parent class)
 7. Create database
   * Query results can be mocked within the app, if database is not functional
 8. Create web interface for administrator users to create batches of teacher accounts/classes
   * This is meant to simplify the tasks of adding multiple teacher accounts/classes, but *can* be done one-by-one inside app

## Product

Goals and tasks:
 
 1. Create workflow
   * Workflow begins from the login screen, and branches to three different user categories: administrator, teacher, and parent
 2. Create wireframe
   * A workflow must be created to ease the creation of the wireframe
 3. Create teacher interface
   * A wireframe must be created for the front-end developers to use as a guide for the interface
 4. Create parent interface
   * A wireframe must be created for the front-end developers to use as a guide for the interface
 5. Create administrator interface
   * A wireframe must be created for the front-end developers to use as a guide for the interface
 6. Create app class structure (eg. parent class)
 7. Create database
   * Query results can be mocked within the app, if database is not functional
 8. Create web interface for administrator users to create batches of teacher accounts/classes
   * This is meant to simplify the tasks of adding multiple teacher accounts/classes, but *can* be done one-by-one inside app

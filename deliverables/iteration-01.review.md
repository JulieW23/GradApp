## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 21st, 2016
 * Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

Decisions turned out well:

1. Deciding on building an Android application to faciliate parent-teacher communication in private daycare and private elementary schools. 

The application will have the following features:
 * A personalized update section where teachers can post and parents can receive both class updates and updates specific to their child
 * A upcoming deadlines section where teachers can post and parents can view upcoming actions required of them (ex. tuition payment, permission form submission, items to bring on special event days or field trips)
 * Push notification for new updates posted
 * Teacher-to-parent and parent-to-parent chat
 * Calendar integration of reminders for parents
 * Event scheduling capabilities for teachers
 * Photo and video sharing from teacher to individual or all parents

This turned out well because an Android application matches our skill set. All members have experience with Java and most with Android. Our research shows there are gaps in existing solutions (HiMama, Daily Sheets, ClassDojo and Tadpoles) our solution can fill (ex. calendar integration, limit on length of videos)

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:
 
1. Website to faciliate parent-teacher communication.

2. Designed for public schools.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:
 
 1. We decided to make the product a mobile application over a website because it should be easier (with more mobility) to use a mobile phone over a computer in the classroom or daycare. Photo updates by a teacher on a mobile website will be more cumbersome as opposed to photo updates via a mobile application on a smartphone. Also, some team members have little or no experience with web development so this will be difficult.
 
 2. We decided to design the application with private daycare and private schools instead of public schools because the burden of purchasing the application and rolling it out falls on the school. A free, self opt-in application may not be very secure. Users of the application must be heavily vetted since photos and other personal data of young students are being shared. Also, parents of private schools or daycares are more likely to have smartphones.

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:
 
1. Evaluated competition. 
Our findings are contained in competitors.md.
2. Established main features of the application which are listed above.
3. Completed user stories. 
User stories are contained in user_stories.md.

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* There were no goals/tasks that were not completed.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

1. Establish main workflow of product for both teacher and parent users.
2. Create wireframe as a reference.
3. Assign developer roles to each team member.
4. Start coding the product.

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a mobile app, Kiddo, that facilitates better communication between teachers and parents. 
The app enables parents to keep track of their child's education by providing a centralized platform for school updates and notifications. Teachers and parents can also communicate via a private chat channel.  Parents can stay in touch with other parents via a group chat. There is calendar support for events created by teachers, which can be viewed by parents. Teachers can send parents pictures of their child in special or everyday school events, which parents may not be able to attend.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

The target users are the teachers and parents of children who attend private daycare or private elementary school. 

These parents are usually working professionals who want to be a bigger part of their child's education, but cannot due to the time commitment. Parents are busy these days, so it makes it difficult for them to speak to teachers, attend parent-teacher meetings, and keep track of what they discuss with their child's teacher or with other parents. 

Teachers have to consider a large number of ways to communicate with children and their parents (flyers, writing in the child's agenda or on his/her work, email, instant messaging, text messaging, phone calls, etc.), and often use multiple methods for each child. Teachers may also have a different way of communicating with each parent, depending on the parent's preference. Thirdly, teachers must use a variety of methods for sharing announcements, reminders, and photos with all parents, and it is difficult to do so simultaneously and securely. Many teachers may be reluctant to take pictures of their class because they are difficult to share and so will not be seen. Currently all of this is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to keep track of. With Kiddo, we hope to securely simplify the way teachers provide updates to parents by having one centralized means of communication.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Private daycare or schools can adopt this application to maintain a competitive edge against rival schools. This application can help a school become more favourable amongst parents since it provides a convenient centralized place for school updates and allows teachers to share photos of precious moments from school events that doting parents would hate to miss out on. It is also another way for the school to integrate more technology into its education, and thus seem more progressive.

Parents can just glance at it while working, and respond with comments or questions. The parents can also be notified in case of emergencies, or be reminded of upcoming deadlines for fees, forms, required items for special events etc. It is not time consuming for the parents. Better communication between parents and teachers can increase the quality of education of a child. The adoption of this mobile application should be high amongst this demographic because they all know how to use a smartphone. This also gives the school an incentive to purchase and roll-out the application, knowing that each child has a parent who can use the application.

Teachers can save a lot of time and effort (mental and physical), currently spent keeping track of communication with each child's parent, (possibly) keeping track of each parent's preferred method of communication, and hand-writing (or typing and then printing) messages to parents. By communicating more effectively, directly, and often with parents, teachers can build a rapport with them and collaborate to enhance the children's educational experience. Teachers can streamline the process of taking and sharing pictures of their class with parents, rather than having to print out the pictures and post them inside/outside the classroom (which is time-consuming).

Apps currently on the market with the same goal include HiMama, Daily Sheets, and ClassDojo. However, our product makes the most sense for parents/teachers because of its carefully-chosen features: we have not found any other app that supports calendar integration, which is a very valuable feature for planning and reminders for parents (many of whom already use online calendars for other areas of their lives). We have also avoided adding too many features, so that user experience is as simple and straightforward as possible.

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 14th, 2016, 2:00pm
 * Where: BA2270

## Process - Reflection

Decisions turned out well:

 * Finalizing the user enrollment process (dividing responsibilities between administrator, parent, and teacher users)
   * Choosing to include an administrator role with specific, limited responsibilities
     * this was something that we had a lot of difficulty figuring out because so many possible arrangements exist with different benefits and drawbacks
     * we had a number of factors to consider, including privacy, usability, time spent by users
     * see user workflow diagram: https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/11406769
 * Adding an administrator web interface

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Once again, list a few (2 - 5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * As before, support your arguments by referring/linking to process artifacts.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * List the changes you are planning to make, if any, from most to least important.
 * For each change, explain why you are making it by referring to a decision that didn't work well.


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * 
 * Displaying events as a calendar

(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why you decided to change your plan and add this goal/task.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.

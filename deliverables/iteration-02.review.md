## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 14th, 2016, 2:00pm
 * Where: BA2270

## Process - Reflection

Decisions turned out well:

 * Deciding on the user enrollment process (dividing responsibilities between administrator, parent, and teacher users)
 * Also, choosing to include an administrator role with specific, limited responsibilities
   * this was something that we had a lot of difficulty figuring out because so many possible arrangements exist with different benefits and drawbacks
   * we had a number of factors to consider, including privacy, usability, time spent by users
   * see user workflow diagram: https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/11406769
 * Adding an administrator web interface
   * this is something that we considered in our product design in iteration 01, in order to simplify the administrator's job, but initially decided not to do because we thought it would be too much to tackle in a single iteration
   * we ended up having enough team resources to re-add this to our list of tasks
 * Division of goals/tasks
   * the fact that we were able to produce a working prototype suggests that we divided the work into tasks well, and that we divided those tasks well between team members
   * see to-do list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15uk3JXhZX96OlqHsnvBWTcIhikaVs2HP3gFrKqHTBb0/pubhtml

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * 
 * Displaying events as a calendar

(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why you decided to change your plan and add this goal/task.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.

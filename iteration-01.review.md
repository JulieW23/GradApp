# Kiddo/Team_5

## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 21st, 2016
 * Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

Decisions turned out well:

1. Deciding on building an Android application to faciliate parent-teacher communication in private daycare and private elementary schools. 

The application will have the following features:
 * Teacher-to-parent and parent-to-parent chat
 * Calendar and event scheduling capabilities
 * Designed for daycares and private schools
 * Photo capabailities

This turned out well because an Android application matches our skill set. All members have experience with Java and most with Android. Our research shows there are gaps in existing solutions (HiMama, Daily Sheets, and ClassDojo) our solution can fill (ex. calendar intregration)

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:
 
1. Website to faciliate parent-teacher communication.

2. Designed for public schools.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:
 
 1. We decided to make the product a mobile application over a website because it should be easier (with more mobility) to use a mobile phone over a computer in the classroom or daycare. Photo updates by a teacher on a mobile website will be more cumbersome as opposed to photo updates via a mobile application on a smartphone. Also, some team members have little or no experience with web development so this will be difficult.
 
 2. We decided to design the application with private daycare and private schools instead of public schools because the burden of purchasing the application and rolling it out falls on the school. A free, self opt-in application may not be very secure. Users of the application must be heavily vetted since photos and other personal data of young students are being shared. Also, parents of private schools or daycares are more likely to have smartphones.

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.
 
1. Evaluated competition: 
2. Established main features of the application: Main features are listed above.
3. Completed user stories: User stories are contained in user stories.txt.

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why you decided to change your plan and add this goal/task.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.

1. Establish main workflow of product.
2. Create wireframe as a reference.
3. Assign developer roles to each team member.
4. Start coding the product.

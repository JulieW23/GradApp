   * assigned to team members based on scope and member's role (eg. front-end-related task is assigned to front-end dev)
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.


## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * App 
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.

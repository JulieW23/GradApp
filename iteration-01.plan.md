## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Mobile app: channel of communication (text and media) between parents and teachers, and between parents
   * Users: elementary school and daycare teachers and parents
   * Objectives:
     * As a parent, I want to be more aware of what my child and his/her class are doing and learning at school, so that I feel more engaged with my child while he/she is at school and can reinforce his/her learning at home.
     * As a parent of a young child, I want a record (pictures, videos) of special moments in my child's school experience, although I can't be there, so that I can preserve and view them later.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with my child's teacher, so that I can discuss my child's performance in school and any relevant details that my child's teacher should know about him/her (eg. illness/injuries, dietary restrictions).
     * As a parent

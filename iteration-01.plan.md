## Product

Goals and tasks:

   * Objectives:
     * As a parent, I want to be more aware of what my child and his/her class are doing and learning at school, so that I feel more engaged with my child while he/she is at school, and so that I can reinforce his/her learning at home.
     * As a parent of a young child, I want a record (pictures, videos) of special moments in my child's school experience, although I can't be there, so that I can preserve and view them later.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with my child's teacher, so that I can discuss my child's performance in school and any relevant details that my child's teacher should know about him/her (eg. illness/injuries, dietary restrictions).
     * As a parent, I want a consistent, reliable, and convenient method of communicating with my child's teacher, so that communication is as easy and quick as possible, and so that I have a point of communication about my child in case of emergency.
     * As a parent, I want a record of the communication between my child's teacher and me, so that I can maintain a dialogue with the teacher, so that I can remind myself of the dialogue at a later date, and so that I can show the dialogue to anyone else as necessary.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with the parents of other children in my child's class, so that I can easily make/receive announcements about the class to/from other parents.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with the parents of other children in my child's class, so that I can easily organize/recruit other parents for class events.
     * As a parent, I want the parents of other children in my child's class to be able to communicate with me without having to share my contact details, so that I can protect my privacy, and so that I can keep this communication separate from other communication in my life.
     
     
     * As a teacher, I want my students' parents to be aware of what their children are doing and learning at school, so that they can reinforce their children's learning at home.
     * As a teacher, I want a direct channel of communication with my students' parents, so that I can discuss their children's performance in school and any other relevant details (eg. behavioural incidents, illness/injuries).
     * As a teacher, I want a consistent, reliable, and convenient method of communicating with my students' parents, so that communication is as easy and quick as possible, and so that I have a point of communication about each student in case of emergency.
     * As a teacher, I want a record of the communication between my students' and me, so that I can maintain a dialogue with each parent, so that I can remind myself of the dialogue at a later date, and so that I can show the dialogue to anyone else as necessary.
     * As a teacher, I want a unified method of communicating with my students' parents - I want all communication that is not in-person to pass through the same channel, rather than using different channels for different topics - so that communication is as easy as possible.
     * As a teacher, I want a single, simple method of making announcements to my students' parents that they are guaranteed to receive, so that I know all of my announcements reach my students' parents with little effort.
     * As a teacher, I want a simple method of taking pictures/videos of my students and sharing them with their parents, so that I can easily and effectively demonstrate the students' school experience.
     * As a teacher, I want to securely share pictures/videos of my students with their parents, so that my students are protected from having their pictures intercepted and distributed online without their parents' consent.

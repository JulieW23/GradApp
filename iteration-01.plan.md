## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Mobile app: channel of communication (text and media) between parents and teachers, and between parents
   * Users: elementary school and daycare teachers and parents
   * Objectives:
     * As a parent, I want to be more aware of what my child and his/her class are doing and learning at school, so that I feel more engaged with my child while he/she is at school, and so that I can reinforce his/her learning at home.
     * As a parent of a young child, I want a record (pictures, videos) of special moments in my child's school experience, although I can't be there, so that I can preserve and view them later.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with my child's teacher, so that I can discuss my child's performance in school and any relevant details that my child's teacher should know about him/her (eg. illness/injuries, dietary restrictions).
     * As a parent, I want a consistent, reliable, and convenient method of communicating with my child's teacher, so that communication is as easy and quick as possible, and so that I have a point of communication about my child in case of emergency.
     * As a parent, I want a record of the communication between my child's teacher and me, so that I can maintain a dialogue with the teacher, so that I can remind myself of the dialogue at a later date, and so that I can show the dialogue to anyone else as necessary.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with the parents of other children in my child's class, so that I can easily make/receive announcements about the class to/from other parents.
     * As a parent, I want a direct channel of communication with the parents of other children in my child's class, so that I can easily organize/recruit other parents for class events.
     * As a parent, I want the parents of other children in my child's class to be able to communicate with me without having to share my contact details, so that I can protect my privacy, and so that I can keep this communication separate from other communication in my life.
